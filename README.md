# 📚 Library Project

A simple library application built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).  
It lets users add books, mark them as read/unread, and remove them — all displayed dynamically in the browser.

- ✅ Mark books as read/unread (toggle status)
